## Challenge
The challenge is to increase user (parent/guardian/ICDS/ASHA worker) engagement on the tracker.
One possible way to achieve this could be through regular notifications-alerting user to periodically
provide data (by means of well-ordered forms) so that development delay can be identified promptly,
or through any other ideas/processes that you can think of.

- If the tracker application identifies a disability in a particular region, a communication should
also be sent to the company, providing them specific details so that well timed assistance can
be provided.
- Besides making the application and hence assistance for disability more accessible, increased
data insights for admins is needed, for instance to be able to view data geographically or
location-wise. This enables easy identification of areas that need extended or specific support.

## Additional Considerations:
The application needs to be taken to the remotest of places where people might have limited access
to stable network. Hence, a lightweight application is preferable. Additionally, special consideration
needs to be given to deal with data uploads from such locations.

- To be able to reach maximum people, the application needs to diversify in terms of lingual
support. A User-Friendly application with Multi-Lingual support would be an added bonus.
- Reminder for parents/users to enroll into company services if there is a developmental delay.
